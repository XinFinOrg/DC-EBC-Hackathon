# decertifierAPI
Welcome to the first version of DeCertifier!

DeCertifier is a tool for certifying groups of documents of the same event, this allows to verify that each document takes part on this event and any of them had been modified.â€¨How it works: it hashes every document, then creates a merkel tree and saves the merkel root in the Blockchain. 
How to verify: Given a document and an eventId, you can verify that this document takes part on the event. As the merkel root is saved on the blockchain, you can check that the merkel tree is valid, then using the merkel tree and the hash of the document you can calculate the merkel proofs
